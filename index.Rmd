# Just a little about Keyanna

* I was born and raise in the small town of Ashburn, Georgia. I love my family. My favorite color is green and I love chocolate. I'm the youngest of two brothers. Out of my two brothers, I have 11 nieces and nephews. I enjoy math very much in my free time I tutor individuals who finds math challenging. I graduated from Albany State University with a B.S in Mathematics. I worked on numerous of projects in my undergrad years. The project I completed Mailman has been by far favorite one. That what drove me to get a degree in Biostatistics.
