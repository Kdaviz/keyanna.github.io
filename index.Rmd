# Just a little about me

I was born and raise in the small town of Ashburn, Georgia. I love my family. My favorite color is green and I love chocolate. I'm the youngest of two brothers. Out of my two brothers, I have 11 nieces and nephews. I enjoy math very much. In my free time I tutor individuals who finds math challenging. I graduated from Albany State University with a B.S in Mathematics. I worked on numerous of projects in my undergrad years. The internship I completed here at Mailman has been by far my favorite. I liked it so much, I decided to stay!!!
